# timber_industry_visualization
This project was completed as a final project for Northwest Missouri State University class 44613 - Data Visualization. The project uses the U.S. Forest Service publication "U.S. timber production, trade, consumption, and price statistics, 1965-2017" to create visualizations and an interactive dashboard.
